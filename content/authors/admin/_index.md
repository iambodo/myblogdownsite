I am a DHIS2 Implementation Adviser with the Global Health Standards & Content Team at the University of Oslo. I am passionate about supporting routine health information systems with open source tools for improved disease surveillance and patient care.

I have worked on novel data collection strategies in "global development" space since 2010. This is my personal site / digital garden where I record my past projects, as well as useful tricks I have found when working with DHIS2, Python, and R.
